# Deezcord Plus
Show what you're listening to on Discord. This is a fork of [Deezcord by CodeMyst](https://github.com/CodeMyst/deezcord).

*Note: Because of the Deezer API it can only display the last song in your history, not the currently playing one.*

### [Downloads on the Release page](https://github.com/b1sergiu/deezcord-plus/releases)

#### Changes from the original Deezcord:
- Uses [DiscordRPC by Lachee](https://github.com/Lachee/discord-rpc-csharp)
- Removed Avalonia
- Runs automatically
